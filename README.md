This application will help you share and keep the score of any game where you have to add or remove points. Originally, I made this app for the card game [Release!](http://inedo.com/release), but I decided to generalise it a bit as it can be useful for any kind of game (e.g.: Scrabble, random hockey game, anything where you need to add and substract points from people, really).

## How to use

It's in heavy development right now, come back in a bit.

## Offline mode

There's no real offline mode for now, but I intend to support it somehow. At least, there will be a mode where you don't have to send commands to the server.
